# Covid-19 self-assessment test and tracker

The project started with the findings that the symptoms of COVID-19 infection are similar to the symptoms of seasonal flu and other infection but this sometimes create the panic conditions for the patient and force them to rush to the biological test centre/labs, this create a heavy load over labs and hospitals/clinics. Also, positive cases keep roaming around hospitals for result and end up spreading infections. So writing these problems that are being figured out in points, these are 1-Panic conditions, 2- Spreading infection before the test, 3-Positive cases are hidden, possibilities, 4-No user feedback after hospitals/lab usage. Tackling these were not easy till they came with the idea of creating a web app that provides the user with a self-assessment test and provides the government with useful data. This system includes symptoms checker that gives the chance of COVID-19 infection to the users and suggests accordingly based on the responses, Cases Tracker that comes with the easy and powerful backend leading to the tracing of positive and negative cases and last but not least an app is loaded with the feature of user feedback to ensure bridging the gap between users and government enabling government to take decisions accurately. So now understand the working behind the COVID-19 Self Assessment Test and tracker, the user (normal people) will have to take the test, this test is simple and has 8 questions which are required to be answered in YES or NO. This test is consist of questions asking for the information related to symptoms and then giving final result in the form of a percentage, that is a chance of having COVID-19 Infection. With automated and evidence-based self-assessment, identify your risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus. Get your real-time evaluation by analyzing simple details such as patientsâ€™ travel history, chronic conditions and more. After getting the result, understand and take the most relevant action based on the result obtained. With the solution, you can get information on the quarantine facilities or find a list of doctors available nearby or connect to the helpline. Also, it can help the government to track down the cases with chances of COVID-19 infection above 70%. This app allows the user to empower themselves with the right education materials such as prevention guidelines, steps that they need to take in quarantine and other information from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to reduce panic and chances of getting affected by the virus.
